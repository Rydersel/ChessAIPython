# Chess AI in Python

AI Uses Alpha-Beta Algorithm

ChessAI AI Engine inspired by work by Dirk and Sam Liu

I focused mainly on the AI for this project so most of the generic chess board code was not written by me (Specific code is credited)

Special Thanks to mbuffett.com's tutorial on 'Creating a basic chess AI with Python'
